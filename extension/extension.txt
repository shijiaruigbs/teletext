Extension

As an extension, I chose to write a program that converts teletext files to very basic html files. This is the tele2html program. This program converts the text within a teletext file to an html file that can be displayed on a web browser.  The font colours defined in the teletext file is also preserved.
  This is a nice extension to the teletext project because it hints at the similarities that contemporary internet technology has to teletext. They both rely on special “codes” to indicate to the renderer how to display the content, these are teletext codes in .m7f files and html tags in the case of html. 
  Although this extension highlights the similarities, it also makes clear the differences. In teletext, control codes change how the content is displayed until another code changes it again. Conversely, html allows for more a more complex structure. Tags must be closed, and tags can be nested in parent child relations that preserve the effects of styling. This gives the designer far more power than teletext does.
  Through this extension I have displayed knowledge of a new language, namely hmtl. Html is a different category of language. C is a procedural language whereas html is a markup language. As well as showing knowledge of a new language I have also shown that I can use C to write content to files in such a way that preserves complex important structures such as those demanded by html.
